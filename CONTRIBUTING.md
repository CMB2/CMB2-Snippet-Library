#Contribute To CMB2 Code Snippet Library

The CMB2 code snippet library is a community-maintained repository and so contributions are always welcome. Thanks to EDD for [the inspiration](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library) for this library.

## Submitting a Snippet

To submit a code library for inclusion in the library, please fork the repository and then submit a [pull request](https://github.com/jtsternberg/CMB2-Snippet-Library/pulls). Pippin has an excellent tutorial for [submitting your first pull request](http://pippinsplugins.com/submitting-your-first-pull-request/).

Guidelines for submission:

- Each snippet should be placed in it's own file.
- Each file should be named appropriately based on the purpose of the snippet.
- Files should be placed in the appropriate category (folder). If no category exists, you may create one with your pull request.
- All functions and classes should be prefixed with your own unique prefix, preferrably one that contains your initials followed by `_cmb2_`. For example: `jt_cmb2_{function name here}`.
- (optional) Add [WordPress plugin headers](http://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header#Plugin_File_Header_Example) to allow others to use your snippet as a plugin.
